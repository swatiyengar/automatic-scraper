# GitHub AutoScraper + history keeper

Using GitHub Actions and Python, this repo automatically scrapes the content of the BBC's homepage every 5 minutes and saves it right into the repo itself.

Just a simple Python-driven example of @simonw's Git Scraping. See also See also autoscraper-mailer, which sends mail, and autoscraper-changes, which only mails if there have been changes.
